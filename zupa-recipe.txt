Instructions
Brown sausage in a large pot or dutch oven.
Remove sausage with a slotted spoon and set aside.
Cut bacon into small pieces.
Add bacon to pot and cook until crispy.
Stir in chopped onion. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes or until onion is translucent.
Stir in minced garlic and cook for 1 minute, stirring frequently.
Add chicken broth and water to the pot. Add crushed red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper if desired.
Add thinly sliced potatoes (I use a mandoline) and the cooked sausage to the pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
Continue cooking until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.
Add the kale to the soup, and simmer for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Stir in the heavy cream and let heat through.
Ladle soup into bowls and serve with Parmesan cheese.
